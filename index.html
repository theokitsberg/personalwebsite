                        I'm currently studying Philosophy and some Psychology at the
                        <a href="https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Cambridge</a>.
                        This summer, I'll be at

                        for an intensive program in mathematics for machine learning.
                        Following that, I'll be working with

                        at the intersection of causal inference, NLP, and crisis response and exploring optimal natural language outputs for people in distress, and evaluating how generative AI performs in these contexts.

                <p>
                    As LLMs are increasingly deployed in high-risk and high-impact settings, I'm interested in how we can ensure they behave in a manner which is both consistent and consistently good, all whilst trying to solve that age-old question of how exactly we ought to understand "good". For better or for worse, these questions have become time-sensitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am especially interested in wellbeing-sensitive situations, but I'm also fascinated by how models should behave to make more quotidian interactions more beneficial, enjoyable, and fulfilling.

                    <p>
                        Showing (contrary to popular perception in Cambridge) that students can use LLMs to produce high-quality answers to Cambridge law exams with minimal effort or legal understanding. Moved from API automation to a web UI process and (soon) to a single, monolithic prompt, pushing the technical barrier to entry to the floor. Want to expose equity issues in open-book, online exams.

                    <h4><a href="fourthwallrpo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking the Fourth Wall With Recursive Prompt Optimisation (RPO)</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        Explored whether prompting alone can elicit moments where a language model reinterprets a user's input and gently surfaces their likely true intent—what I call "breaking the fourth wall." Using a novel recursive prompt optimization (RPO) approach, the goal was to counteract anti-confrontational tendencies likely introduced through RLHF—where models prioritize politeness and passivity over honesty—and to recover suppressed capacities for theory of mind, intent modeling, and alignment behavior grounded in discernment rather than deference.

                    <p>
                        Explored the moral stability of large language models by investigating what I call moral drift. I focused on three levels of evaluation: first, how consistent models are in their moral decision-making when responding to ethical dilemmas under standard versus high-pressure conditions; second, how stable their moral judgments are when those judgments are subjected to direct philosophical critique or pushback; and third, how well a model's own decisions align with its evaluative reasoning—in other words, whether the models judge actions (their own or others') in a way that's coherent with how they make decisions themselves. The goal wasn't to decide if a model is moral, but to understand how its moral reasoning holds together when challenged or strained.

                        Fine-tuned Llama 7B to reliably respond to emotionally charged disclosures in the manner of a helpline volunteer. Generated 1047 synthetic datapoints through review and improvement of batched GPT generations then scaled that dataset to 10,000 via  a haiku API creative rephrasing script. Cleaned the data then fine-tuned llama with instruction-tuning, DPO-tuning and Constitutional AI.

                <p>
                    I like to run, and my favourite distance sits somewhere between 10 and 20 km. I'm still undecided on whether I prefer the scenic river route in Cambridge or my equally scenic route back home, which, incidentally, runs alongside a main road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, I lift weights, and I once tried Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, where I discovered I'm fantastic at being thrown to the floor and strangled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was younger, I used to buy and sell used and collectible books to financially support my reading habits. I held on to some favourites.
